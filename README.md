I had to build this ugly website as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
I am not really a fan of brutalist web design tbh. But hey, I tried to be fair by building the project along the way.
Can't wait to start with javascript.
If someone is reading this, I just want to let you know that I am amazed by your curiosity. Have a great day !
